# Reports
This repository contains reports on short investigations that I have conducted. The reports will be either about applying mathematics to real world scenarios, like the reports on the statistical analysis of climate data and insuarance data, or theoretical investigations, such as the report on theoretical probability distributions related to fractional Brownian motion.
